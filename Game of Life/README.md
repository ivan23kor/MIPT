## Installation requirements
The game was tested and written using Ubuntu 16.04 and, in general, Windows sucks,
thus the instructions below are for Unix users. If you are from Windows, map the steps to Windows-like yourself.
### As the project is written in C++, you need a compiler:
* .`sudo apt-get install g++`
### You also need Make:
* .`sudo apt-get install build-essential`
